- [ ] Add Terms of Service URL
- [ ] Document data collection practices:
  - Camera: For taking food photos
  - Photo Library: For selecting existing food images
  - User data: Meal logs, macros (stored locally & with user account)

### 3. App Icon & Splash Screen
- [ ] Design professional app icon (1024x1024)
- [ ] Update `./assets/images/icon.png`
- [ ] Update splash screen
- [ ] Update `./assets/images/splash-icon.png`

### 4. Info.plist Permissions (iOS)
Add to app.json under `ios`:
```json
"infoPlist": {
  "NSCameraUsageDescription": "Fuel needs camera access to photograph your meals for macro analysis.",
  "NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription": "Fuel needs photo library access to select food images for macro analysis."
}
```

### 5. Testing
- [ ] Test on physical iOS device
- [ ] Test camera functionality
- [ ] Test photo selection
- [ ] Test Claude API integration (ensure API key is secure)
- [ ] Test offline behavior
- [ ] Test authentication flow (all 3 methods)
- [ ] Test sign out and data persistence
- [ ] Test saved meals
- [ ] Test trends/analytics
- [ ] Test edge cases (no meals, large datasets)

### 6. API & Backend
- [ ] Move Flask server to production hosting (Heroku, AWS, etc.)
- [ ] Secure API key (use environment variables, never commit)
- [ ] Update `src/services/api.js` with production server URL
- [ ] Add rate limiting/usage monitoring for Claude API
- [ ] Consider costs: Claude API usage per user

### 7. Build & Deployment
```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login to Expo
eas login

# Configure build
eas build:configure

# Build for iOS
eas build --platform ios

# Submit to App Store
eas submit --platform ios
```

### 8. App Store Assets Needed
- [ ] App Name: "Fuel - Precision Nutrition Tracking"
- [ ] Subtitle: "AI-Powered Macro Tracker"
- [ ] Keywords: nutrition, macros, calories, protein, diet, fitness, AI, food
- [ ] Promotional text (170 chars)
- [ ] Description (4000 chars max)
- [ ] Screenshots (3-10 images per device size)
- [ ] App preview video (optional but recommended)

### 9. Legal Requirements
- [ ] Privacy Policy (required)
- [ ] Terms of Service
- [ ] Support URL
- [ ] Marketing URL (optional)
- [ ] Copyright statement

### 10. Clerk OAuth Configuration
For production:
- [ ] Get custom Google OAuth credentials (Client ID/Secret)
- [ ] Get Apple Sign In credentials
- [ ] Configure in Clerk Dashboard (use custom, not shared)
- [ ] Test OAuth shows "Fuel" not "Expo"

## üö® Critical Issues to Address

### 1. API Key Security
**URGENT**: Your Claude API key is currently in `server.py`. This needs to be:
- Moved to environment variable
- Never committed to git
- Secured in production

```python
# server.py - Use environment variable
import os
API_KEY = os.environ.get('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')
```

### 2. Server Hosting
The Flask server currently runs locally. For production:
- Deploy to cloud service (Heroku, Railway, Fly.io, AWS Lambda)
- Update API_BASE_URL in `src/services/api.js`
- Use HTTPS (required for production)
- Consider serverless (AWS Lambda + API Gateway) for cost efficiency

### 3. Cost Management
Claude API usage costs money:
- Estimate: ~$0.01-0.05 per food analysis
- 1000 users √ó 3 meals/day √ó 30 days = 90,000 API calls/month
- At $0.03/call = $2,700/month
- **Solution**: Implement usage limits, freemium model, or subscription

### 4. Offline Support
Currently requires internet for:
- Claude API analysis
- User authentication
What happens when offline?
- [ ] Add offline detection
- [ ] Queue failed API calls for retry
- [ ] Show appropriate error messages

### 5. Data Backup
User data is stored locally (AsyncStorage):
- [ ] Implement cloud sync for logged meals
- [ ] Backup to user's Clerk account
- [ ] Consider database (Firebase, Supabase, PostgreSQL)

## üìù Recommended Improvements

### Before V1 Launch
1. **Error boundaries** - Catch crashes gracefully
2. **Loading states** - Better feedback during API calls
3. **Haptic feedback** - Better touch response
4. **Onboarding** - Tutorial for first-time users
5. **App Store optimization** - Better description, keywords
6. **Analytics** - Track usage (Amplitude, Mixpanel)

### Post-Launch Features
1. Barcode scanner for packaged foods
2. Recipe builder
3. Meal planning
4. Integration with fitness trackers
5. Social features (share meals)
6. Export data (CSV, PDF)
7. Custom macro goals
8. Weekly reports
