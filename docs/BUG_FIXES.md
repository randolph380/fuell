## Saved Meals Navigation Bug (Fixed)

### **Issue Description**
After logging a saved meal, the app would stay on the SavedMeals screen. When manually navigating back to the Home screen, it would display yesterday's data instead of today's data, requiring manual forward/back/forward navigation to fix.

### **Root Cause**
The `logSavedMeal` function in `SavedMealsScreen.js` was missing navigation back to the Home screen after successfully logging a meal, unlike the `logMeal` function in `CameraScreen.js` which properly navigates back.

### **Solution**
Added `navigation.navigate('Home')` to the `logSavedMeal` function after successful meal logging.

### **Files Modified**
- `src/screens/SavedMealsScreen.js` (line ~132)

### **Code Change**
```javascript
// Before:
await HybridStorageService.saveMeal(meal);
Alert.alert('Success', 'Meal logged successfully! ðŸŽ‰');
setExpandedMealId(null); // Collapse after logging

// After:
await HybridStorageService.saveMeal(meal);
Alert.alert('Success', 'Meal logged successfully! ðŸŽ‰');
setExpandedMealId(null); // Collapse after logging

// Navigate back to Home screen after logging
navigation.navigate('Home');
```

### **Testing**
- âœ… Logging saved meals now navigates back to Home
- âœ… Home screen shows correct date data
- âœ… No manual navigation required to fix date display
- âœ… Consistent behavior with other meal logging methods
