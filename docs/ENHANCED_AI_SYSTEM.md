# Enhanced AI System Documentation

## Overview

The Fuel app now features a significantly enhanced AI system that provides much more accurate macro estimation through database-driven analysis, scientific validation, and intelligent portion estimation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Improvements

### 1. **Per-Item Database Retrieval**
**What it does**: Forces the AI to identify each food item and attempt to match it against authoritative databases.

**Databases Used**:
- **USDA FDC**: Primary source for whole foods (fruits, vegetables, meats, grains)
- **Open Food Facts**: Packaged and branded food items with barcode data
- **Restaurant Menus**: Chain restaurant menu items with standardized nutrition

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates guessing and estimation errors
- Provides exact nutritional data when available
- Clear source attribution for transparency
- Flags unmatched items for user verification

### 2. **Enhanced Portion Estimation**
**What it does**: Uses reference objects and multi-angle analysis for accurate portion sizing.

**Reference Objects**:
- **Credit Card** (3.375" Ã— 2.125") - Most reliable reference
- **Fork** (7-8 inches) - Very common in food photos
- **Standard Dinner Plate** (10-12 inches) - Common serving context
- **Hand/Palm** - For protein portion estimation

**Multi-Angle Analysis**:
- Uses different image angles to triangulate portion size
- Cross-references measurements between images
- Uses depth perception cues for 3D volume estimation

**Density Conversion**:
- **Proteins**: 0.8-1.0 g/cmÂ³ (chicken, beef, fish)
- **Starches**: 0.6-0.8 g/cmÂ³ (rice, pasta, bread)
- **Vegetables**: 0.3-0.5 g/cmÂ³ (leafy greens, broccoli)
- **Fats**: 0.9-1.0 g/cmÂ³ (oils, butter, cheese)

### 3. **Recipe Decomposition & Cooking Methods**
**What it does**: Parses complex meals into ingredients and applies scientific cooking method multipliers.

**Cooking Method Multipliers**:
- **Frying**: +15-25% oil absorption, +5-10% water loss
- **Grilling**: +5-10% oil absorption, +10-15% water loss
- **Steaming**: No oil, +5-10% water gain
- **SautÃ©ing**: +10-15% oil absorption, +5-10% water loss

**Default Templates**:
- **Fried Rice**: Base rice + vegetables + protein + 2-3 tbsp oil
- **Stir-fry**: Base vegetables + protein + 1-2 tbsp oil
- **Pasta with sauce**: Base pasta + sauce ingredients + cooking oil

### 4. **Hard Consistency Checks (Atwater Constraints)**
**What it does**: Enforces scientific energy balance validation.

**Formula**: |calories - (4Ã—carbs + 4Ã—protein + 9Ã—fat)| â‰¤ 10 calories

**Automatic Rescaling**:
- Identifies least certain macro and rescales to fit constraint
- If rescaling >20% of any macro, asks user for clarification
- Ensures all estimates follow established nutritional science

### 5. **Confidence & Active Query System**
**What it does**: Provides transparency and engages users when accuracy is uncertain.

**Per-Item Confidence** (0-1 scale):
- **0.9-1.0**: Exact database match with precise portion
- **0.7-0.8**: Good database match with estimated portion
- **0.5-0.6**: No database match, visual estimation only
- **0.0-0.4**: High uncertainty, multiple interpretations

**Active Queries**:
- If overall certainty <0.6, asks ONE targeted question
- Examples: "Is this white rice or fried rice?", "Was this cooked with oil or steamed?"
- Questions designed to change outcome most significantly

## ðŸ“Š Enhanced Response Structure

The AI now returns much more detailed information:
